## Justification for the use of technologies 
### React
#### Lighter and more flexible for a landing page. 
React is a library focused on the view layer (UI), ideal for dynamic yet simple pages like a landing page.
Angular is more robust than necessary and may be too “heavy” for this use case.
#### Easier future integration with e-commerce 
React integrates very well with tools like Next.js (for SSR/SEO), Stripe, Firebase, Shopify, etc.
#### Better performance for static or hybrid sites. 
With frameworks like Next.js, you can turn your landing into a very fast static site with excellent performance and SEO
